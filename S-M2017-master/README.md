# Sharks and Minnows
Online multiplayer game similar to Aggar.io. Players connect to central server and the game begins with the client controlling a minnow. A minnow swims around in search of food. Upon eating enough food, a minnow turns into a shark. The shark is powerful, capable of eating regular food, as well as minnows themselves. The goal of the game is to become a powerful shark, stay in that state for as long as possible. A player's time as a shark increases as they consume food. The more you eat, the longer you remain a shark.
